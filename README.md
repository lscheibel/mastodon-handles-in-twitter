# Mastodon Handles in Twitter
This is a Chrome extension which tries to find the Mastodon handle of a Twitter user and display it next to their tweets.

It works very similarly to [Debirdify](https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/) by searching through Twitters user bios.

## Installation

1. Download this repository (Code > Download as zip) and unpack it somewhere.
2. Then head over to chrome://extensions/, enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner and select "Load unpackaged" in the top left corner.
3. Select the folder at the location where you unpacked it.
4. Go to [Twitter](https://twitter.com)

You should now start to see mastodon handles next to peoples tweets if they mention their handle in their bio.
